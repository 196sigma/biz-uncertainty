abstract = "The accounting literature has traditionally focused on firm-level studies to examine the capital market implications of earnings and other accounting variables. We first develop the arguments for studying capital market implications at the aggregate level as well. A central issue is that diversification makes equity investors at least partially and potentially almost completely immune to several firm-level properties of earnings by holding diversified portfolios. Diversification is particularly important when assessing the welfare consequences of random errors in accounting measurement (imperfect accruals) and, to the extent it is independent across firms, of deliberate manipulation (earnings management). Consequently, some firm-level metrics of association, timeliness, value relevance, conservatism and other earnings properties do not map easily into investor welfare. Similarly, earnings-related risk manifests itself to equity investors largely through systematic earnings risk (covariation with aggregate earnings and/or other macroeconomic indicators). We conclude that the design and evaluation of financial reporting must adopt at least in part an aggregate perspective. We then summarize the literature in accounting, economics and finance on aggregate earnings and stock prices. Our review highlights the importance of studying earnings at the aggregate level."

We introduce a measure for narrative disclosure—the degree to which the MD&A differs from the previous disclosure—and provide three findings on the usefulness of MD&A disclosure. First, firms with larger economic changes modify the MD&A more than those with smaller economic changes. Second, the magnitude of stock price responses to 10-K filings is positively associated with the MD&A modification score, but analyst earnings forecast revisions are unassociated with the score, suggesting that investors—but not analysts—use MD&A information. Finally, MD&A modification scores have declined in the past decade even as MD&A disclosures have become longer; the price reaction to MD&A modification scores has also weakened, suggesting a decline in MD&A usefulness.},

We also show that errors in CFO expectations of earnings growth are predictable from past earnings and other data, pointing to extrapolative structure of expectations and suggesting that expectations may not be rational. This evidence, like earlier findings in finance, points to the usefulness of data on actual expectations for understanding economic behavior. }

We find that changes in ownership by institutions with large positions in a firm are consistent with informed trading. However, other previously documented proxies for private information produce results more consistent with risk-based trading (e.g., investment style) or insignificant in the presence of other proxies (e.g., fiduciary type). We also find that informed trading is more prevalent in small firms and when the large positions are taken by investment advisers and large institutions.},

In equilibrium, the quantity and quality of information affect asset prices.

   we expect public banks to have more incentives to report steadily

   (3) report longer strings of consecutive earnings increases. These

Based on the ``realizable'' and the ``earned'' criteria of SFAC No. 5 (FASB in Concepts statement no. 5. Recognition and measurement in financial statements of business enterprises, 1984), revenues should reflect both selling price and timing of delivery. of those two aspects, selling-price estimates are required for revenue recognition when standalone selling prices for products and services are not available. In this study, I examine the effects of selling-price estimates in revenue recognition on the contracting and informational roles of financial statements. Particularly, I examine the setting of SOP 97-2 (AICPA in Software revenue recognition. Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, AICPA, New York, 1997) that removed software firms' flexibility to recognize revenues using selling-price estimates. I find that SOP 97-2 implementation did not improve the contracting role of earnings.

The result is driven by the portfolio returns of the extreme deciles of changes in institutional ownership, suggesting that institutions trade based on information about future earnings, but that such trading is not widespread. We also find that the difference between earnings announcement returns of the extreme deciles of change in institutional ownership is much greater when change in institutional ownership of a stock is driven by relatively few institutions, measured using the skewness of the distribution of change in institutional ownership of the stock. This result suggests that when fewer differentially informed investors make disproportionately large purchases or sales of stocks, a greater amount of the information on which they base their trades is not impounded in prices until the subsequent earnings announcement. Finally, we show that our results obtain for institutional investors with short-term focus, such as independent advisors, investment companies and insurance companies, but not for institutional investors with long- term focus, such as internally managed pension funds, educational institutions, and private foundations. This result further supports our conclusions regarding informed trading by institutions based on information about forthcoming earnings.},

Following an expansion (contraction) in the availability of bank loans, leverage ratios of bank-dependent firms significantly increase (decrease) relative to firms with bond market access.

Using a set of alternative comparability measures, our results suggest that the overall comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption is marginal. We hypothesize that firm-level heterogeneity in IFRS compliance explains the limited comparability effect. To test this conjecture, we first hand-collect data on IFRS compliance for a sample of German and Italian firms and find that firm-, region-, and country-level incentives systematically shape IFRS compliance. We then use these compliance determinants to explain the variance in the comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption and find that only firms with high compliance incentives experience substantial increases in comparability. Moreover, we document that firms from countries with tighter reporting enforcement experience larger IFRS comparability effects, and that public firms adopting IFRS become less comparable to local GAAP private firms from the same country.",

These empirical results are consistent with the latter interpretation.},

Abstract = {{This paper examines whether institutional investors create or reduce
   incentives for corporate managers to reduce investment in research and
   development (R\&D) to meet short-term earnings goals. Many critics argue
   that the frequent trading and short-term focus of institutional
   investors encourages managers to engage in such myopic investment
   behavior. Others argue that the large stockholdings and sophistication
   of institutions allow managers to focus on long-term value rather than
   on short-term earnings. I examine these competing views by testing
   whether institutional ownership affects R\&D spending for firms that
   could reverse a decline in earnings with a reduction in R\&D. The
   results indicate that managers are less likely to cut R\&D to reverse an
   earnings decline when institutional ownership is high, implying that
   institutions are sophisticated investors who typically serve a
   monitoring role in reducing pressures for myopic behavior. However, I
   find that a large proportion of ownership by institutions that have high
   portfolio turnover and engage in momentum trading significantly
   increases the probability that managers reduce R\&D to reverse an
   earnings decline. These results indicate that high turnover and momentum
   trading by institutional investors encourages myopic investment behavior
   when such institutional investors have extremely high levels of
   ownership in a firm; otherwise, institutional ownership serves to reduce
   pressures on managers for myopic investment behavior.}},

Using data from the Report of the Financial Analysts Federation Corporate Information Committee (FAF Report 1985-89), we provide evidence that firms with more informative disclosure policies have a larger analyst following, more accurate analyst earnings forecasts, less dispersion among individual analyst forecasts and less volatility in forecast revisions. The results enhance our understanding of the role of analysts in capital markets. Further, they suggest that potential benefits to disclosure include increased investor following, reduced estimation risk and reduced information asymmetry, each of which have been shown to reduce a firm's cost of capital in theoretical research.},

The disclosure rating increases are accompanied by increases in sample firms' stock returns, institutional ownership, analyst following, and stock liquidity. These findings persist after controlling for contemporaneous earnings performance and other potentially influential variables, such as risk, growth, and firm size. While it is difficult to draw unambiguous causal conclusions, these results are consistent with disclosure model predictions that expanded disclosure leads investors to revise upward valuations of the sample firms' stocks, increases stock liquidity, and creates additional institutional and analyst interest in the stocks.},

We also provide a new definition of the firm, and show how our analysis of the factors influencing the creation and issuance of debt and equity claims is a special case of the supply side of the completeness of markets problem. The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.

Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

Our empirical results confirm this theoretical prediction. Our approach is not subject to the Kaplan and Zingales (1997) critique, and sidesteps problems stemming from unobservable variation in investment opportunities. Thus, our results strongly suggest that financing frictions affect investment decisions.},

   schemes in a variety of applications common to capital market research.
   Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes have been available since
   1939 but are being replaced by North American Industry Classification
   System (NAICS) codes. The Global Industry Classifications Standard
   (GICS)(SM) system, jointly developed by Standard \& Poor's and Morgan
   Stanley Capital International (MSCI), is popular among financial
   practitioners, whereas the Fama and French {[}1997] algorithm is used
   primarily by academics. Our results show that GICS classifications are
   significantly better at explaining stock return comovements, as well as
   cross-sectional variations in valuation multiples, forecasted and
   realized growth rates, research and development expenditures, and
   various key financial ratios. The GICS, advantage is consistent from
   year to year and is most pronounced among large firms. The other three
   methods differ little from each other in most applications.}},

   either the likelihood of delisting or the premium paid by the bidder.

abstract="As part of its push for more plain English in disclosures, the SEC argues that firms should use more concrete language to make abstract concepts clearer to investors. We use two experiments to show that, when concrete language is highlighted in a prospectus, investors are significantly more willing to invest in a firm than when abstract language is highlighted. Furthermore, we show the effect of concrete language is particularly important when investors feel more psychologically distant from a firm. Drawing on psychology theory, we predict and find that concrete language increases investors' feelings of comfort in their ability to evaluate an investment. Our study contributes to the literature on how language choices in disclosures affect investors' judgments by demonstrating that a simple, yet potentially powerful reporting tool of emphasizing concrete language may attract investors who may otherwise be reluctant to invest.",

 abstract = {This paper provides a positive theory of voluntary disclosure by firms. Previous theoretical work on disclosure of new information by firms has demonstrated that releasing public information will often make all shareholders worse off, due to an adverse risk-sharing effect. This paper uses a general equilibrium model with endogenous information collection to demonstrate that there exists a policy of disclosure of information which makes all shareholders better off than a policy of no disclosure. The welfare improvement occurs because of explicit information cost savings and improved risk sharing. This provides a positive theory of precommitment to disclosure, because it will be unanimously voted for by stockholders and will also represent the policy that will maximize value ex ante. In addition, it provides a "missing link" in financial signalling models. Apart from the effects on information production analyzed in this paper, most existing financial signalling models are inconsistent with a firm taking actions which facilitate future signalling because release of the signal makes all investors worse off.},

Abstract = {{In this study we examine the relation between corporate governance and
   institutional ownership. Our empirical results show that the fraction of
   a company's shares that are held by institutional investors increases
   with the quality of its governance structure. In a similar vein, we show
   that the proportion of institutions that hold a firm's shares increases
   with its governance quality. Our results are robust to different
   estimation methods and alternative model specifications. These results
   are consistent with the conjecture that institutional investors
   gravitate to stocks of companies with good governance structure to meet
   fiduciary responsibility as well as to minimize monitoring and exit
   costs.}},
