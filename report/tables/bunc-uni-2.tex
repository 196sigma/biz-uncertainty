 \caption{\textbf{Determinants of Business Uncertainty}}  																				
 \label{cossim-uni}																				
\caption*{\footnotesize This table presents univariate regression results of business uncertainty on firm characteristics. $BUNC$ is the firm-level of uncertainty in a specific year. Data span all stocks listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, or American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and all industries over the years 1994 to 2017. 

$AGE$ is the number of years the firm appears in Compustat.																				
$TURNOVER$ is the ratio of monthly trading volume to number of shares outstanding.																				
$RETURN$ is the stock return over the preceeding year.																				
$PRICE$ is the average daily stock price over the preceeding year.																				
$ASSETS$ is the natural logarithm of the book value of assets.																				
$MVE$ is the natural logarithm of market capitalization.																				
$NANALYSTS$ is the natural logarithm of the number of analysts following the firm.																				
$PE$ is the forward price-to-earnings ratio, computed as the current price divided by the 1-year-ahead consensus analyst forecast for the firm.																				
$BASPREAD$ is the average bid-ask spread.																				
$SP500$ an indicator variable for whether or not the firm is in the S\&P 500.																				
$DIV$ is the dividend yield .																				
The ratio of the book value of total debt to assets ($LEVERAGE$.)																				
Tobin's $q$ ($Q$), calculated as in \cite{chungpruitt1994}.																				
Return on assets  ($ROA$)--the ratio of net income to the book value of total assets.
$LOSS$ is a dummy variable equal to one if $ROA$ is less than zero.									The level of asset tangibility ($TANG$), calculated as in \cite{almeidacampello2007}. All variables are winsorized at the 1\% and 99\% level.}
