To Do
* analyze each FF48 industry separately; use in forecasting
* randomly select 100 10-Ks/Qs and read them to determine where uncertainty is usually discussed. Use this to motivate which section(s) of the filings to extract. Get HB to help :)
* see McGuckin and Stiroh (2002) paper on aggregating economic data
* get some Graham/Graham and Dodd quotes
* integrate more methodological info into paper. Describe how and why you measure the outcome variables the way you do.
* add LOSS
* disaggregate time trends of uncertainty terms
* think about how to summarize data by industry
* censored regression?
* scale RD by assets
* Data collection: funnel analysis, quarterly filings, whole 10-K/Q


TEXT PREPROCESSING
1. number of CIKs in COMPUSTAT
2. COMPUSTAT CIKs matched with CRSP PERMNO
3. COMPUSTAT-CRSP CIKs with 10-K on EDGAR
4. 10-Ks that are not essentially blank (too small)
5. 10-Ks with extracted MD&A's

Paper Structure
* Focus a good chunk (30-50%) of the paper on descriptives of your uncertainty metric. Breakdown time series trends, cross-sectional differences, industry structure, by-term descriptives.
* whats the process of generating MD&A's by managers/firms?
* what physical events in the real world generat business uncertainty (besides govt policy uncertainty)?
* based on prior lit, what might uncertainty be used to explain (eg investment, M&A, debt...)
* validate measure 
	- prior uncertainty measures
	- firm-level manager range forecasts
	- independent of length, tone, etc.
* In first pass, use entire time-series to explain (in-sample). Then use training sample to generate weights and model then do out-of-sample prediction.
* Use VAR framework
* Macroeconomic aggregates (GDP, inflation, employment) as a sub-section
* aggregate tests
* firm-level tests
* asset pricing tests: pack in a condensend, standard "anomalies" test at the end for completeness. 

OUTLINE
I. Introduction
	* Why is uncertainty important? Based on prior lit, what might uncertainty be used to explain (eg investment, M&A, debt...)
	* Why use 10-K and 10-Q MDA\&A's? whats the process of generating MD\&A's by managers/firms? (Review the lit)
	* Overview of forecasting procedure and results
	* Lit review
II. Measuring Uncertainty
	* how is uncertainty measured? What physical events in the real world generate business uncertainty (besides govt policy uncertainty)?
	* How is your index constructed?
	Since the length of filings has increased steadily over time, I construct my index by normalizing by filing length. To do so, I count the number of words (tokens) in the MD\&A and divide the number of uncertainty terms by this. I equal-weight (or value-weight) the fraction of uncertainty terms and add them together.
	* What are its empirical properties
	* validate measure 
		- prior uncertainty measures: market volatility, Baker et al (2016) EPU
		- firm-level manager range forecasts
		- independent of length, tone, etc.
III. Measuring Accounting Aggregates
	* Which accounting aggregates do you use?
	* How do you contruct these aggregates?
	* What are their empirical properties?
		- summary stats
		- time series structure
IV. Results
	A. OLS. The goal of this section is to measure how much BUNC contributes to explaining each agg measure
		1. Investment.
			* Controls: changes in market volatility, interest rates, default spread on corporate bonds, profits, returns
			* Fully interact BUNC with controls
	B. VAR Estimation and Forecasting. The goal of this section is to predict future agg measures using BUNC and compare it to a baseline without BUNC.
		* What is VAR and why is it appropriate here?
		* Estimation choices
		* Results
V. Macroeconomic aggregates
VI. Asset Pricing Tests (Firm-level/cross-sectional)
VII. Conclusions and Further Work

Uncertainty words
